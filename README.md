# ❤️‍🩹 Heart Disease Prediction with Logistic Regression

> **A polished R‐powered pipeline for early detection of cardiac risk**, blending classic statistics with modern data science flair.

## 🎯 Project Synopsis

In this repository, we harness the **Cleveland Heart Disease** dataset to build a robust **logistic regression** classifier in **R** that flags patients at risk of heart disease. Through meticulous data wrangling, insightful exploratory analysis, and rigorous model evaluation, we achieve a **64.61 %** accuracy and an **AUC of 0.72**—laying the groundwork for future enhancements with sophisticated algorithms or interactive dashboards.

## 🌟 Why It Matters

> Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection via accessible clinical variables can dramatically improve patient outcomes. This project demonstrates how a statistically sound model, built with everyday tools, can serve as a **first line of defense** in cardiovascular risk assessment.
